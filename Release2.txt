What is a block-level element? What are some examples of block-level elements? What are they used for?

In HTML, block level element occupies the entire space of itâ€™s parent element within the <body> element, creating a block. Block-level elements always begin on new lines and take up the full width available. Some examples are <p> (paragraph), <table>, and <li> (list item). Block-level elements are useful when you do not need or choose not to set a width and height.
